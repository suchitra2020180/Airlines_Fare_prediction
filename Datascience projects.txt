jupyter notebook looks like a wessite or webpage but it is not a web page or static pageas wecan execute.

##To make a note in jupyter 
3hashes and write text and chnage the code to markown
### Datascience (select dropdown)then Alt+enter.

jupyter.org==> supports 40 programming languages
Data: Raw information from n sources like transformational data from e-commerce, survey, images data

science: process of exploring data to get some insights of data.
Applying scientific methods to extract some insights from data (all about analysis an prediction using scientific methods like deep learning, AI and time series).

Ex: Lets think we have 2 routes to reach office (A and B). A pathe is shortest but probability of traffic is high and B is longest path.
Now our problem is to find the fastest path to reach office and we need t collect information accoring to data.

>>>Steps in data science:
1. Identify the datascience problem
2. Collect data according to the problem
3. Data preprocessing--(remove unnecessary things): it is the process of making the ata ready for analysis and prediction.
Data exploration and visualisation.
>>Applications:
1.Uber/Ola
2. Google maps==> u will reach in this time.
3. Amazon recommenation products
4.Netflix recommenation
Traffic , facebook, instagram,


>>>Life cycle of Datascience and ML projects (PROCESS OF EXECUTION)
STEP1: Usecase: It is our problem like we need to predict if the person is diabetic or not.
Step2: Business understanding(Dta collection involves Business analytics and subject expert)
sTEP3: Finding data (Data analyst/data scientist) through thor party APIs, databases, data sources==> All these data was trnsferre to Big data Engineer==> perform Data trnsformation to data to get Data quality==> then sent to data scientist(checks ata is in right format or not) for prediction
step4: Data cleaning (missing values 
step5: Feature engineering***imp step(takes 70% time)(check each and every feature so that it is applicable to ML ALGO)
STEP6: Feature encoding (categorical data like gender): string data is not applicable to ML since machine learning is all about mathematics, probablity,vectors,linear algebra, stochastic process.
a)Nominal data==. perform Onehot encoding==> pd.get_dummies(df['colname'], drop_first=True) (##drop_first=TRUE MEANS REMOVES REPETATIVE ROWS)
B)Ordinal data ==> perform label encoding
step7:Feature selection (select k features from n features(k<n)
step8: Depending of usecase (Regression, classification, clustering, time series)
 apply ML 
step9: Hyper parameter tuning==> to find the optimised parameters
